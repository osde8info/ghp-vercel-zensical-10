There's now yet another variant of Ubuntu "[Ubuntu NetBook Remix](http://www.canonical.com/netbooks)"  for netbooks and webooks such as the ASUS EEE ! Apparently [wi-fi doesn't work](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/ubuntu_netbook_remix_detailed_explanation) so maybe I should wait for OpenSolaris Redux !
